# FLEXIBLE-ROBOTIC-ARM
This project involves analyzing and controlling a flexible robot arm system using various approaches. The system consists of a motor, two masses, a spring, and a load. The goal is to design controllers that stabilize the system and achieve specific damping ratios and natural frequencies. The project involves using transfer function and state space representations, designing both continuous and discrete-time controllers, implementing controllers in Simulink, and analyzing the system's response to various inputs and disturbances. The project also explores the effect of changing the sampling interval on the system's response.
